# Shared parameter model

This GitHub repo was set up to share example (simulated) data and code for running a shared parameter model.

Documentation:

1. Please see our IJE paper for a full description of the SPM: 
   https://academic.oup.com/ije/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ije/dyab086/6296150?guestAccessKey=96f401f7-d141-4ded-b795-5ca173d8eabe
2. The [SPMpseudocode.pdf][] file contains some helpful information and a basic description of the models and fitting algorithms.

Data: 

1. [simdata.csv][] is the example dataset (Brain Atrophy, Cognitive Decline & Dementia; simulated from ARIC)

Code: 
1. [spm.do][]:    Stata code for shared parameter model
2. [spm.sas][]:   SAS code for shared parameter model
3. [spm.R][]:     R code for shared parameter model
 
Enjoy!
